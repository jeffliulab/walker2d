# walker2d

This is a RL project focus on solving details of classic RL task walker2d.

This is one of two parts of Tufts University's Reinforcement Learning course final project. This project focus on policy-based methods, while another one focus on value-based methods: [breakout](https://github.com/jeffliulab/rl_brick_game)

## Stable-baseline3 Demo

I have firstly implement a stable-baseline3 based demo, to demonstrate how PPO solve this problem. But this is not what this project focus. I will fully design and implement Policy Gradient Methods and try implement PPO.
